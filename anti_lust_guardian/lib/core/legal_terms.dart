TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE & PRIVACY AGREEMENT

LAST UPDATED: November 2025

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
By accessing or using the "Anti-Lust Guardian" application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must uninstall the App immediately.

2. NATURE OF THE SERVICE
The App is a digital wellness tool designed to block access to adult content and "dopamine trap" applications (e.g., short-form video feeds). It uses advanced monitoring technologies to enforce these restrictions.

3. PERMISSIONS AND MONITORING
You explicitly grant the App permission to:
a) Monitor Screen Content: The App uses Machine Learning and Accessibility Services to read text and analyze images on your screen in real-time.
b) Block Applications: The App has the authority to forcibly close ("kill") other applications if prohibited content is detected.
c) Bypass Privacy Modes: The App employs "Content Scraper" technology to detect threats even in "Incognito" or "Private" browser modes.
d) Collect Local Data: The App logs URL visits and usage statistics locally on your device.

4. PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY
a) Local-Only Processing: We guarantee that screen analysis and NSFW detection are performed strictly on-device. No screen content is transmitted to our servers.
b) Data Incineration: You have the right to permanently delete ("Incinerate") all local data via the Privacy Dashboard.
c) Liability: While we use industry-standard encryption, we are not liable for data breaches resulting from device compromise (rooting/jailbreaking) or physical theft.

5. GUARDIAN LOCK AND UNINSTALLATION
a) The App may require a PIN or biometric authentication to change settings or uninstall.
b) You acknowledge that this feature is intentional and designed to prevent impulsive disabling of the App.

6. HEALTH AND SAFETY DISCLAIMER
a) Not Medical Advice: The App is a productivity tool, not a medical treatment for addiction. Consult a professional for clinical issues.
b) Withdrawal Symptoms: We are not liable for any psychological distress, anxiety, or "withdrawal" symptoms arising from the blocking of dopamine-stimulating content.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP.

8. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

BY CLICKING "ACCESS GRANTED", YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
