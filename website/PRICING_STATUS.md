# ❌ WEBSITE IS BROKEN - FIXING NOW

## Problem
The HTML file got corrupted during editing. The pricing section and other sections are incomplete or missing.

## What I'm  Doing
Recreating the ENTIRE website file from scratch with:
- ✅ Neural network background
- ✅ Cursor glow
- ✅ FREE 7-day trial pricing
- ✅ $17/month after trial
- ✅ $299 lifetime
- ✅ Your credit in footer
- ✅ All features

## Flutter App Status
✅ CORRECT - Shows "FREE for 7 days, then $17/month" and "$299 lifetime"

Creating new clean website file now...
