# Quick Fix - Add This to Your backend/.env File

Add this line to `backend/.env`:

```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_from_stripe
```

**What's your webhook URL?** Tell me and I'll document it properly so it doesn't get lost again.

**Or if you have the webhook secret handy, just add the line above to backend/.env and replace with your actual secret.**

My mistake - I should have preserved your existing config. Sorry about that!
